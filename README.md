# Emotion Graph-Enhanced Response Generation

## Project Overview

Emotion Aware Response Generation is an advanced AI-driven conversational system designed to generate emotionally intelligent and contextually appropriate responses. By integrating cutting-edge emotion detection, graph-based context tracking, This project aims to revolutionize human-AI interactions with genuinely empathetic communication.

## Key Features

### Emotion Intelligence
- Advanced emotion detection
- Context-aware response generation
- Dynamic emotional state tracking

### Technical Innovations
- Fine-tuned LLaMA language model
- Custom emotional graph database
- Multi-task learning framework
- Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (LoRA)
